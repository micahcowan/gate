- Enemies shouldn't suddenly appear in front of gate, but should run in from gate.

- Enemies accelerate towards destinations? Cubic bezier was nice idea,
  but using the real acceleration is too jittery, and getting cubic
  roots for constant speed is too hard.

- visual/audio cues to explicitly deny teleportation to player shot, as
  this is apparently slightly perplexing.

- visual cue as player draws near open gate, to clue towards teleport.

- Fix sound in Safari (is ogg the difference?)
